
In my machine the location is D:\AlgoDat\Exercises\A05

And the name of my java file is SegmentIntersection.java

So bash script for running in PowerShell CommandPrompt will be as follows:

d:
cd D:\AlgoDat\Exercises\A05
javac SegmentIntersection.java   //Compiling
java SegmentIntersection         //Running

                                 //Display of my result
